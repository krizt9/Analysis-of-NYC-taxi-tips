## Abstract
This paper goes through a big data exploratory analysisand data mining workflow using a distributed data processing environment.  Specifi-cally, it presents an analysis of tips in New York Cityâ€™s taxi rides from January 2009to June 2016 using the R programming language and the Apache Spark platform. Al-though twenty-three features have been explored and three different models have beentrained, the research shows that predicting tips in taxi rides is a difficult task and thattipping is mostly motivated by social pressure.
