## Abstract
This paper goes through a big data exploratory analysis and data mining workflow using a distributed data processing environment. 
Specifically, it presents an analysis of tips in New York City's taxi rides from January 2009 to June 2016 using the R programming language and the Apache Spark platform. 
Although twenty-three features have been explored and three different models have been trained, the research shows that predicting tips in taxi rides is a difficult task and that tipping is mostly motivated by social pressure.
